✅ Real Estate Scraper Dev Log — Islamabad 🇵🇰 | Zameen.com Project

Today I set up a full-fledged web scraper using Selenium to collect housing data from Zameen.com — focused on listings in Islamabad.

At first, things didn’t go smoothly…

🔍 Issue:
The script was skipping all listings despite no visible error in code. I double-checked the logic, the selectors, the loops — but still no data was being written to the CSV.

😓 Turns out… I forgot to `Ctrl + V` the updated CSS selectors. That minor copy-paste miss made me panic for a bit and waste time debugging the wrong things.

⚙️ Fixes & Steps I Took:
- ✅ Updated my ChromeDriver to match the latest version of Chrome (the scraper wouldn’t even start before that)
- ✅ Re-verified the DOM structure of Zameen.com by manually inspecting the title, price, beds, etc. and grabbed the **accurate class names**
- ✅ Set up Selenium with `Options()` to avoid popups and ensure lazy-loaded listings would load after scrolling
- ✅ Implemented graceful error handling — listings with missing fields are skipped, and progress is logged clearly

📦 Output:
- Title
- Price
- Location
- Number of Beds
- Baths
- Area in Marla/Kanal

Data is saved to `zameen_islamabad.csv` with no loss even if stopped manually.

Next up: I’ll be analyzing the data with Pandas and working on a **Price Prediction ML model** based on Islamabad real estate trends 🚀
